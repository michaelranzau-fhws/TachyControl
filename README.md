# TachyControl
This is part of a control and measurement software for current total stations. For full functionality install the OpenCV wrapper 
EmguCV from https://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/ and add the library path to the path variable. In the Visual Studio project
add Emgu.CV.UI.dll and Emgu.CV.World.dll to the referenced files.

Because of ristrictions in publishing the native GeoCOM commands from Leica Geosystems, the TSControl library can only be hand
over on demand. Please contact michael.ranzau@fhws.de to get full access to all needed files.
